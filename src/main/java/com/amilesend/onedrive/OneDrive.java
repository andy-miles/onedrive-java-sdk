 * {@link OneDriveFactoryStateManager} instead. Doing so simplifies OAUTH authentication and persists the
 * authentication tokens for reuse. Without it, consumers are responsible for initiating the OAUTH handshake
 * to obtain the authorization code and managing persisted refresh tokens for future instantiation without
 * requiring the user to re-authorize the consumer application with their OneDrive account.
